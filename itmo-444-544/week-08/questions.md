# Exercises - Chapter 05 Application Architecture

1. What is scaling?

2. What are the options for scaling a service that is CPU bound?

3. What are the options for scaling a service whose storage requirements are growing?

4. The data in Figure 1.10 is outdated because hardware tends to get less expensive every year. Update the chart for the current year. Which items changed the least? Which changed the most?

5. Rewrite the data in Figure 1.10 in terms of proportion. If reading from main memory took 1 second, how long would the other operations take? For extra credit, draw your answer to resemble a calendar or the solar system.

6. Take the data table in Figure 1.10 and add a column that identifies the cost of each item. Scale the costs to the same unit—for example, the cost of 1 terabyte of RAM, 1 terabyte of disk, and 1 terabyte of L1 cache. Add another column that shows the ratio of performance to cost.

7. What is the theoretical model that describes the different kinds of scaling techniques?

8. How do you know when scaling is needed?

9. What are the most common scaling techniques and how do they work? When are they most appropriate to use?

10. Which scaling techniques also improve resiliency?

11. Research Amdahl’s Law and explain how it relates to the AKF Scaling Cube.
