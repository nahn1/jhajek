# Lab Week-08 Network Layer

## Objectives

* Explore and explain the nature of Network Layer packet structure
* Explore and describe the per-router functions in the network layer
* Explore and describe the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
* Explore and describe the data plane and control plane abstractions of the Network layer
* Explore and describe how traditional IP forwarding works

### Questions

1. In the Network Layer packet structure, based on the bit-size what is the theoretical length of a Network layer packet Datagram length?  
i)
2. Based on the default MTU (maximum transmission unit) of the data link layer, datagrams are usually no bigger than what size?  
i)
3. The default IP datagram header (with no options) is of size 20 bytes (160 bits), how is this value calculated and stored in the header length field?  
i)
4. What are the two main values we see in the protocol field of a IP datagram?  
i)
5. What kind of ~~decimal~~ numerical notation does IPv6 use (binary, decimal, or hexadecimal)?  
i)
6. What is the value range for each octet of an IPv4 address?  
i)
7. How many total possible IPv4 addresses are there?  
i)
8. What are the three main principles of Net Neutrality set by the US FTC in March 2015?  
i)
9. In routing, what is the difference between a FIFO scheduler and a Priority Queue?  
i)
10. What is a CIDR block used for?  
i)
11. There are four items inside of a router, list the four elements and briefly describe them?  
i)
12. The Network layer provides a single service known as the ______-effort service.  
i)
13. What does the term Forwarding mean in relation to routers?  
i)
14. What does the term Routing mean as opposed to Forwarding?  
i)
15. The Network layer can be split in to two layers, what are these two layers?  
i)
16. Which organization do Registrars and ISPs get IP address blocks from?  
i)
17. What is the North American Internet Registry?  
i)
18. Recall that the  name of a transport-layer packet is segment and that the name of a link-layer  packet is frame. What is the name of a network-layer packet?  
i)
19. What is the role of a forwarding table in a router?  
i)
20. Suppose that an arriving packet matches two or more entries in a routerâ€™s forwarding table. what rule does a router apply to determine which of these rules should be applied  to determine the output port to which the arriving packet should be switched?  
i)
