# Review Questions for Intro to Networking

These are the weekly review questions.

## Outcomes

At the conclusion of this homework you will have covered the basic introduction to the internet and networking. You will be able to describe what an protocol is,  what access networks are, what the network edge and core are, what packet switching, delay, protocols, and layered service models. These concepts are the building blocks of networking and being able to explain the functioning of the internet.

### Questions

There are twenty questions

1. Why are standards important for protocols?  
i)
1. List four access technologies. Classify each one as home access, enterprise  access, or wide-area wireless access.  
i)  
1. List the available residential access technologies in your city. For each  type of access, provide the advertised downstream rate, upstream rate, and  monthly price.  
i)
1. What are the ranges of transmission rate for Ethernet LANs?  
i)
1. What are some of the physical media that Ethernet can run over?  
i)
1. HFC, DSL, and FTTH are all used for residential access. For each of  these access technologies, provide a range of transmission rates and  comment on whether the transmission rate is shared or dedicated.  
i)
1. Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a  receiving host. The transmission rates between the sending host and the  switch and between the switch and the receiving host are R1 and R2, respectively. Assuming that the switch uses store-and-forward packet switching,  what is the total end-to-end delay to send a packet of length L? (Ignore queuing, propagation delay, and processing delay.)  
i)
1. What advantage does a circuit-switched network have over a packet-switched network?  
i)
1. Suppose users share a 2 Mbps link. Also suppose each user transmits continuously at 1 Mbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 20 percent of the time. Why will there be a queuing delay if three users transmit at the same time?  
i)
1. Why will two ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy often peer with each other? How does an IXP earn money?  
i)
1. Some content providers have created their own networks. Describe what motivates content providers, like Netflix and Google, to create these networks?  
i)
1. Consider sending a packet from a source host to a destination host over a fixed route. List the delay components in the end-to-end delay. Which of these delays are constant and which are variable?  
i)
1. What are the five layers in the Internet protocol stack? What are the principal responsibilities of each of these layers?  
i)
1. What is an application-layer message?  
i)
1. A transport-layer segment?  
i)
1. A network-layer datagram?  
i)
1. A link-layer frame?  
i)
1. Which layers in the Internet protocol stack does a router process?  
i)
1. Which layers does a link-layer switch process?  
i)
1. Which layers does a host process?  
i)
